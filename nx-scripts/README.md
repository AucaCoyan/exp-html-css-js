# nx-scripts

Operations I would want to do:

- [ ] increment the bugfix dependency number (x.x.+1)
- [ ] increment the minor dependency number (x.+1.x)
- [ ] increment the major dependency number (+1.x.x)

- [ ] print the current version of all my workspace dependencies in a table
- [ ] compare these versions with another branch (for example main, or QA envs)
