# json-performance-measure

Based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuCK81q1edU) I tried to reproduce the test

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.13. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
